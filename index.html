        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>My name is Nevis Macintyre.  I am currently in the p-tech program at Snp steam acadamy, and I currently work part-time at The Keg.
          The languages I have worked with so far are java, php, and html.  I am working to improve myself by putting away the distractions in my daily life 
          and focusing on my school work and my job.   I don't know what job I what in specifically in the future, but I know I want to create things.  Coding has
          given me a way to create anything as long as I work hard enough and put in the effort.

          <h3>Why I Want to Code</h3>
          <p>
            I have always wanted to be an artist of any kind, but I'm not good at drawing, writing, or playing instruments.  I love coding because to me it's a form of art that I can understand
            and create.  Problem solving is one of my favorite things about coding.  The feeling of solving an issue with your code is one of the most rewarding feelings I've ever felt. 
          </p>
